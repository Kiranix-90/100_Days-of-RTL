# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of RTL â€“ Verilog HDL Projects

Welcome to my 100 Days of RTL challenge!  
Over these 100 days, I'm implementing various digital circuits using Verilog HDL to strengthen my understanding of RTL design.  
Each day covers a new moduleâ€”from logic gates and flip-flops to counters, shift registers, and more.  
All designs are simulated and verified using Xilinx Vivado.  
This repository documents my progress with code, testbenches, and waveforms.  
Join me on this journey into the world of digital hardware design! ðŸš€
